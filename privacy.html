                <p>
                    This Privacy Policy governs our policies and practices with respect to the personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) and other data that is collected by Zefr, Inc. (“Zefr”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”) in connection with our website, located at https://suite.zefr.com (the “Site”) and our related Services. When we use the term “Services,” in this Privacy Policy, we mean the Site and Suite, which consists of the tools, including the Software, services, features, content, and applications, that ZEFR has developed for use in conjunction with Google Ads (“GA”) and Google Display & Video 360 (“DV360”).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third-party websites, services and applications (“Third Party Services”) that you elect to access through the Service or to individuals that we do not manage or employ. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third-Party Services you access.
                </p>
                <h3>YouTube Provisions Related to Zefr Software and Suite Users</h3>
                <p>If you are signed up to use Suite, please be aware that Suite accesses and uses YouTube’s API Services, which provides information related to third-parties’ use of YouTube (“Public Users”).  As a user of these services through Suite (“Suite User”), you are subject to YouTube’s privacy policy, which is located at  <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy.">http://www.google.com/policies/privacy.</a></p>
                <p>Suite does not access, collect, store, or otherwise use any information about Suite Users through the YouTube API. Aggregated information about Public Users is never personally identifiable to any particular Public User.   Any such information is used and shared internally solely for the purposes of providing Suite Users the services made available via Suite, and the information is never shared or otherwise made available to third parties.</p>
                <p>Suite does not provide Public User data to third parties to serve any content on its platform, including advertisements.  In addition, it only places cookies or otherwise collect information from Suite Users’ devices as disclosed in the third paragraph of the section entitled “Information Collection & Use” below.</p>
                <p>If Suite Users have authorized Zefr to access their data via the API Services, then in addition to Suite’s normal procedure for deleting stored data, Suite Users may revoke Suite’s access to their data by visiting Google’s security settings page at <a href="https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions">https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions</a>.</p>
                <p>With any other questions or complaints regarding Suite’s privacy policies, please contact us via e-mail at support@zefr.com.</p>
                <h3>provisions related to api for google user data</h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="underline">Who is Requesting Google User Data?</span> When you log into our extension for the first time, you will be asked to grant permission for the extension to access and use the user data provided through the Google API.  The identity of the extension will be shown as ZEFR.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="underline">What Data is the Application Requesting?</span> There are two types of Google user data accessed through the API.  The first type of data is campaign data, which consists of your targeting details, your ad details including ID’s of associated videos and ads, and the names and ID’s associated with the different levels (parent and child) of ad campaigns.  The bulk of the data passed through the Google API consists of this campaign data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second type of data accessed via the Google API is user personal data.  User personal data consists of first name, last name, email address, browser type, user ID, IP address, and similar data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All user data (campaign data and user personal data) is accessed using a third party, Auth0, so we do not ever have access to that data, except to provide the services we’ve described.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="underline">Why do We Request Google User Data?</span>  We request the Google campaign data to provide the services you request using the extension.  We use the user personal data to verify that the user is actually an authorized user.
                </p>
                <h3>Information Collection &amp; Use</h3>
                <p>
                    The information we gather enables us to personalize, improve and continue to operate the Site and our Services. In connection with certain aspects of the Site, we may request, collect and/or display some of your Personal Information. We collect the following types of information from our users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="italic">Information Collected Upon Registration.</span> When you create an account, you will be required to become a registered user, and to submit certain Personal Information to ZEFR. Personal Information that we may collect in such instances may include your full user name, password, email address, city, time zone, telephone number, and other information that you decide to provide us with, or that you decide to include in your profile.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="italic">Cookies.</span> Cookies are pieces of text that may be provided to your computer through your web browser when you access a website. Your browser stores cookies in a manner associated with each website you visit. Like many websites and services, we use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit the Site and otherwise use the Site through the Internet. Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are. However, we do use cookies to identify that your web browser has accessed aspects of the Site and may associate that information with your account if you have one. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties. We do not control when or how third parties place cookies on your computer. For example, third party websites to which a link points may set cookies on your computer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="italic">Usage Data.</span> When you interact with the Site, our servers automatically receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information (“Usage Data”). This Usage Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting, the Site pages you visit, the search terms you use, and any advertisements on which you click. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider, the IP address will be different every time you log on. We do not associate your IP address with any other Personal Information to identify you personally, except in cases where we are asked to comply with a subpoena or other legal demand or where we suspect that there has been a violation of our policies, our Terms of Service and/or applicable law.
                </p>
                <h3>Use of Information</h3>
                <p>
                    We will use your Personal Information in order to provide you with access to our Services, to help us improve the content and functionality of the Services and to better understand our users. If you contact us by email through the Services, we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence, and may use your email address, and any information that you provide to us in your message, to respond to you. In addition, we may use your contact information to market to you, and provide you with information about our products and services and the products and services of our partners that we believe may be of interest to you.
                </p>
                <h3>Sharing of Information</h3>
                <p>
                    Your information is an important aspect of our relationship with you. However, there are certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Information with certain third parties without further notice to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="italic">Usage Data.</span> We use Usage Data to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users’ movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We may share this data with our affiliates, agents and business partners. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our Services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="italic">Service Providers.</span> We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us, including, without limitation, hosting and maintenance, customer relationship, database storage and management, and direct marketing campaigns. We may share your Personal Information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="italic">Business Transfers.</span> ZEFR may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="italic">Social Media Services.</span> You may be able to access certain third party social media Web sites and services through our Services (such as YouTube) (“Social Media Services”). When you do so, you are sharing information with those Social Media Services, and the information you share will be governed by their privacy policies and terms of service. You may also be able to modify your privacy settings with these Social Media Services to, for example, control what information the Social Media Services disclose to third parties like ZEFR. When you add Social Media Service accounts to the Service or log into the Service using your Social Media Services account, we will collect relevant information necessary to enable our Service to access that Social Media Service, but you will provide your login information, like your password, directly to such Social Media Service (and not to ZEFR). The manner in which Social Media Services use, store and disclose your information is governed by the policies of such third parties, and ZEFR shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any Social Media Services that may be enabled within the Service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="italic">Protection of Legal Rights and Security.</span> We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believes is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce  our <a href="/terms.html">Terms and Conditions</a>, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention.
                </p>
                <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
                <p>
                    We recognize the privacy interests of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children’s online activities and interests. This Site is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not target our Services to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.
                </p>
                <h3>Security</h3>
                <p>
                    We may employ procedural and technological security measures that are reasonably designed to help protect your personally identifiable information from loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. We may use firewalls, password protection, secure socket layer and other security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to your personally identifiable information. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. We will make any legally-required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored Personal Information to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.
                </p>
                <h3>Processing of Personal Information</h3>
                <p>
                    Our computer systems are currently based in the United States, so your personal data will be processed by us in the U.S. where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union. If you create a user account with our Site as a visitor from outside the United States, by using our Site you agree to this Privacy Policy and you consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States, which may not offer an equivalent level of protection of that required in the European Union or certain other countries, and to the processing of that information as described in this Privacy Policy.
                </p>
                <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
                <p>
                    Due to the Internet’s rapidly evolving nature, we may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If so, we will post our updated Privacy Policy on the Site located at the following URL: http://legal.zefr.com/privacy.html and post notice of the change so it is visible when users log-on for the first time after the change is posted. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Your continued use of the Site and/or continued provision of personally identifiable information to us will be subject to the terms of the then-current Privacy Policy.
                </p>
                <h3>Questions</h3>
                <p>
                    If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy or use of your personally identifiable information, please contact us via email at support@zefr.com.

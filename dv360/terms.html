                                <u>Internal Use</u>. The Services are for Subscriber’s use for its own internal business purposes, except with respect to any exceptions or intended applications expressly set forth on the Order Form.  Use of Services is subject to the terms set forth in this Agreement, including the terms of any third-party software described in and incorporated herein pursuant to Section 9.2, and the restrictions set forth in this Section 2 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

Subscriber shall use reasonable efforts to prevent any unauthorized use of the Services and Documentation and will immediately notify ZEFR in writing of any unauthorized use that comes to Subscriber’s attention and any suspected unauthorized use. If there is unauthorized use by anyone who obtained access to the Services directly or indirectly through Subscriber, Subscriber shall take all steps reasonably necessary to terminate the unauthorized use. Subscriber shall cooperate and assist with any actions taken by ZEFR to prevent or terminate unauthorized use of the Services or Documentation.

                                <u>Implementation and Customization Services</u>.

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <u>Technical Support Services</u>. So long as Subscriber is current in payment of the Fees and is not in default of any material terms of this Agreement, ZEFR shall provide tier one support to Subscriber for critical Services failures resulting in complete or substantial shutdown of the Services within one business day of any request, and ZEFR shall respond to all other support requests (as set forth in this Section 3.2, the &quot;<em>Technical Support Services</em>&quot;) as soon as reasonably and commercially practical on an as needed basis at its own cost and expense.  The support in using the Services may occur at the discretion of ZEFR by phone, email, or mail request(s) to ZEFR for help on incidental needs related to use of Services.  Subscriber shall also have web access to online ZEFR training materials, if available, for its internal use only, at no additional charge.

                                <u>Consideration</u>. As compensation for the License of the Services set forth in Section 1 above, Subscriber shall pay the Fees as set forth in Section 5.1 and any Order Form. If an Order Form contains a trial or beta period (a &quot;<em>Beta Period</em>&quot;) for a specific period, the Fees for such period shall be waived during the Beta Period. Unless Subscriber terminates such Order Form in writing at least five days prior to the end of such Beta Period, the Order Form shall automatically continue in effect for the remainder of the term set forth on such Order Form, and the Fees for such Order Form (less any Fees accrued during such Beta Period) shall become due and payable in accordance with Section 5.1 of this Agreement.

                                <u>Content</u>.  Subscriber hereby represents and warrants that (a) it owns, controls, or has all necessary rights to and for the use of all content which Subscriber uses in the DV360 Platform (&quot;<em>Content</em>&quot;) and (b) the use of the Content does not infringe, misappropriate, or violate any intellectual property right or any other right of any third party, including, without limitation, copyright, patent, trademark, or moral rights or any other third party right.

                                <u>Retention of Rights</u>.

                                <u>Disclaimers</u>. Except as expressly set forth herein, ZEFR makes no representation or warranty of any kind, and specifically disclaims any warranty, that: (i) it will be able to identify any particular level of fan uploaded content on any website, (ii) it will achieve any particular level of financial results, business partnerships, promotions, or affiliations for Subscriber, or (iii) it will be able to optimize or advance search or advertising results with respect to Subscriber or its Content on any website.

                                 <u>License</u>. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Subscriber hereby grants to ZEFR, during the Term, (i) such rights and authorizations as are necessary or required by Google LLC and hereinafter, &quot;<em>Google</em>&quot;) for ZEFR to perform or provide access to the Services, (ii) the right and license to use, reproduce, publicly perform and publicly display Subscriber trademarks, service marks and logos (&quot;<em>Marks</em>&quot;), in accordance with usage guidelines for the Marks which may be provided by Subscriber in writing from time to time, for the sole purpose of ZEFR’s performing its obligations and exercising its rights and licenses granted herein or as is required of ZEFR by Google pursuant to its sublicense with ZEFR with respect to the subject matter hereof,  and (iii) all other rights, licenses and authorizations as are necessary or required for ZEFR to grant the License or perform or provide access to the Services and its other obligations under this Agreement, including, without limitation, authorization for ZEFR to create and manage an account with Google on behalf of Subscriber.

                                <u>Fees and Payment Terms</u>. ZEFR’s fees for the Services specified on the Order Form (the &quot;<em>Fees</em>&quot;) are set forth in the applicable Order Forms and will be a percentage, set forth on such Order Form(s), of amounts paid by Subscriber to Google with respect to any spend that utilizes the Services. By clicking [&quot;ACCEPT&quot;] on an Order Form submitted to ZEFR, Subscriber agrees to pay to ZEFR the Fees set forth on such Order Form. Fees are due within 30 days of the date of ZEFR’s invoice, which will be issued by ZEFR monthly to Subscriber’s billing contact set forth on the Order Form, which billing contact may be updated by Subscriber upon 30 days’ written notice to ZEFR. For purposes of clarity, Fees will be based on a percentage of actual spend in the applicable calendar month and not over the course of the entire term of the Agreement. Any amount not paid when due shall be subject to finance charges equal to 1.5% of the unpaid balance per month or the highest rate permitted by applicable usury law, whichever is less, determined and compounded daily from the date due until the date paid. Subscriber shall reimburse any costs or expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by ZEFR to collect any amount that is not paid when due pursuant to this Agreement. Amounts due from Subscriber pursuant to this Agreement may not be withheld or offset by Subscriber against amounts due to Subscriber for any reason. All amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement are denominated in United States dollars, and Subscriber shall pay all such amounts in United States dollars.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Subscriber shall pay Google directly for any fees charged or required by such parties for media purchased by Subscriber. Subscriber will be the responsible billing entity on all services accounts with such parties, regardless of whether ZEFR created such accounts.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                During the term of this Agreement and for three years thereafter, Subscriber shall keep current, complete, and accurate records regarding the reproduction, installation, and use of the Services and results of the Services.  Subscriber shall provide such information to ZEFR and certify that it has paid all fees required pursuant to this Agreement within fifteen business days of any written request.  Subscriber shall, after reasonable prior notice from ZEFR, provide ZEFR, and its representatives, reasonable access to Subscriber’s premises, records, and personnel so that ZEFR may audit and confirm that Subscriber is in compliance with this Agreement.  If an audit reveals any reproduction, installation, use, or distribution of the Services that is not in compliance with this Agreement, Subscriber shall promptly comply with this Agreement and make an additional payment as necessary to bring Subscriber into compliance with this Agreement, plus interest at the rate specified in this Section 5.  If the amount of the underpayment is 5% or greater, Subscriber shall promptly reimburse ZEFR for its reasonable costs of conducting such audit.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <u>Taxes</u>. Other than net income taxes imposed on ZEFR, Subscriber shall bear all taxes, fees, duties, and other governmental charges (collectively, &quot;<em>taxes</em>&quot;) resulting from this Agreement. Subscriber shall pay any additional amounts as are necessary to ensure that the net amounts received by ZEFR after all such taxes are paid are equal to the amounts that ZEFR would have been entitled to in accordance with this Agreement as if the taxes did not exist. For the avoidance of doubt, if ZEFR has the legal obligation to pay or collect taxes for which Subscriber is responsible under this Section, the appropriate amount shall be invoiced to, and paid by, Subscriber unless Subscriber provides ZEFR with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority.

                                <u>Term</u>. This Agreement shall commence upon the date hereof and continue for one year (the &quot;<em>Initial Term</em>&quot;) unless this Agreement is terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  For the avoidance of doubt, the License, and Services shall commence upon the delivery of a login granting Subscriber access to the Services, which shall in no event be later than twenty business days following the Effective Date of the initial Order Form.  This Agreement shall automatically renew for additional one year periods, unless at least 60 days before the end of the then-current term either party provides written notice to the other party of its election not to renew. If there are no Order Forms outstanding, then at such time, this Agreement may be terminated by either party after delivering written notice to the other.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <u>Termination for Material Breach</u>. Either party may terminate this Agreement if the other party does not cure its material breach of this Agreement within 30 days of receiving written notice of the material breach from the non-breaching party. Termination in accordance with this Section 6.2 shall take effect when the breaching party receives written notice of termination from the non-breaching party, which notice must not be delivered until the breaching party has failed to cure its material breach during the 30-day cure period. If Subscriber fails to timely pay any Fees, ZEFR may, without limitation to any of its other rights or remedies, suspend the License of the Services, and cease performance of any Technical Support Services until it receives all amounts due.  In addition to the foregoing, ZEFR reserves the right to terminate this Agreement in the event that Google takes any actions which materially restrict ZEFR’s ability to provide the License, or to perform or provide access to the Services set forth herein, including, but not limited to, restricting access to information necessary for the performance of the Services.  In the event of any such termination, ZEFR shall refund any then unused, prepaid fees for the remainder of the then-current term.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <u>Effect of Termination</u>. If this Agreement is terminated for any reason, (a) Subscriber shall pay to ZEFR any Fees or other amounts that have accrued prior to the effective date of the termination, (b) any and all liabilities accrued prior to the effective date of the termination shall survive, (c) Subscriber shall provide ZEFR with a written certification signed by an authorized Subscriber representative certifying that all use of the Services and Documentation by Subscriber has been discontinued, (d) ZEFR may charge a separate set-up fee to Subscriber if it wishes to activate Services at a later date, and (e) Sections 2, 6, 7, 8, 9.3, 10, 11, 12 and 13 shall survive termination.

                                <u>Trade Secrets</u>.  The Services are trade secrets of ZEFR and contain valuable proprietary products and information of ZEFR, embodying substantial creative efforts and confidential information, ideas, and expressions.  Subscriber shall take appropriate action to protect the confidentiality of the Services.  Subscriber shall not modify, translate, disassemble, create Derivative Works based on, reverse-assemble, reverse-compile or otherwise reverse-engineer the Services in whole or in part, or otherwise use, copy, reproduce or distribute any deliverable except as expressly permitted hereunder.  The provisions of this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

Included in such license is the right to (i) identify or reference Subscriber as a user of ZEFR’s Services and a right to use Subscriber’s logo in connection therewith, and (ii) perform and make public a case study with respect to Subscriber and its use of the Services and results of the Services.
